# FarmFast

FarmFast is a web application developed by myself and two other coders at DivHacks 2022. Inspired by UberEats and food delivery services alike, FarmFast offers food delivery from local farms and farmer's markets. All trasnport would be by bike in order to minimize our carbon footprint. We intend to give people the option to have a more eco-friendly lifestyle.
