**FarmFast**

FarmFast was collaboratively develolped at Columbia University DivHacks 2022. The hackathon was sponsored by Palantir and it's theme was sustainability. My team was inspired by food delivery services like UberEats and wanted to offer consumers a more eco-friendly option. We came up with FarmFast! FarmFast is a food delivery service that specializes in produce from local farms and farmer's markets. Not only does FarmFast stimulate local economies, but we're eco-friendly too. 100% of FarmFast deliveries are made by bike. This helps us minimize our carbon footprint, and makes it easier for you to have a more sustainable lifestyle.

I specifically designed the layout of our website and contributed to the front-end development of each webpage.
