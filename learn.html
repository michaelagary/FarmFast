        <b>Health Benefits</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Freshly grown produce at farmers markets has more nutrients and
              vitamins and has spent less time being transported or stored from
              the time it was harvested.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fruits and vegetables that are grown in season taste better.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <b>Environmental and Social Impacts</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The fast food industry encourages harmful practices like factory
              farming. Tightly packed animals produce manure that leaks into and
              contaminates water supplies. Mass farming also requires mass
              deforestation, which contributed 8-10% of the yearly carbon
              dioxide emissions between 2015-2017.<sup>1</sup>
            </li>

            <li>
              Supporting local farmers helps keep them in business and provide
              eco-friendly, fresh produce to more people. According to the
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln, "On average, only 10 cents of each
              food dollar returns to the farmer", but "farmers who sell direct
              to consumers receive 80 cents of each food dollar".<sup>2</sup>
              Local farmers produce less food waste, greenhouse gas emissions,
              and support the local economy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Buying from local farmers helps people get more involved in the
              community.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <b>Why should you care?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Climate change impacts <em>everyone</em> - increasing storms, wildfires,
              flooding, and water shortages and endangering wildfire
            </li>
            <li>
              We are already seeing the consequences of climate change and it
              will only get worse unless people make eco-friendly changes in
              their lifestyle to limit overconsumption and waste.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <b>How can you help?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Good News: there are small, easy changes everyone can make
              that have a significant impact!

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Buy local produce <u>through FarmFast</u> 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use refillable waterbottles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take public transportation or bike a few times a week instead
                  of driving.
                </li>
                <li>Bring your own reuseable bags to the grocery store.</li>
                <li>Go vegetarian or vegan just one day of the week.</li>
                <li>
                  Think ahead when ordering food or buying groceries to limit
                  food waste.

        <b>Environmental Impacts</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Food waste contributes 6-8% of yearly greenhouse gas
              emissions.<sup>3</sup>
            </li>
            <li>
              Wasting food means wasting the water, time, and energy that went
              into growing, harvesting, and transporting that produce to grocery
              stores. In addition, the "estimated one-third of all the food
              produced in the world goes to waste" and ends up in the
              landfill, which releases large amounts of methane.<sup>3</sup>
